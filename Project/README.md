## 📌 Project Overview
Morocco is currently facing one of its most severe droughts in decades. This project utilizes **Machine Learning (Random Forest Regressor)** to analyze historical climate data (rainfall, temperature) and predict future water stress levels in major dams.

The goal is to provide a data-driven tool for decision-makers to anticipate water scarcity scenarios.

## 🚀 Key Features
- **Data Analysis:** Processing 20+ years of climate and dam filling rate data.
- **Modeling:** Implementation of `RandomForestRegressor` for high-accuracy predictions.
- **Interactive Simulation:** A script to simulate future scenarios (e.g., "What if rainfall drops by 20%?").
- **Visualization:** Time-series analysis using `Matplotlib` and `Seaborn`.

## 📂 Repository Structure
- `Morocco_Water_Stress_Prediction.ipynb`: **(Main File)** The complete analysis and code in English.
- `Fr-version/Stress_Hydrique_au_Maroc.ipynb`: The French version of the analysis.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Python** (NumPy, Pandas)
- **Scikit-Learn** (Random Forest, Model Evaluation)
- **Matplotlib/Seaborn** (Data Visualization)

## 📊 Results
The model successfully predicts the dam filling rates with a low Mean Absolute Error (MAE), demonstrating a strong correlation between rolling rainfall averages and water storage levels.
